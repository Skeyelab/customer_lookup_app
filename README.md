Customer Lookup App
===================

This is a New Zendesk app to streamline the process of manually logging incoming calls.

How do you use it?

The agent inputs a telephone number into the app and then a lookup is performed for users with that telephone number.

If a user is found, that user is set as the requester of the ticket.

If multiple users are found, the agent can select which user to set as the requester.

If no users are found, a simple form appears that allows the agent to create a new user. There are 3 fields, name, email and organisation.
You can specify in the admin settings which fields are required.
The name and organisation field automatically capitalise the first letter of every word.
There is validation on the email address to make sure it is entered in the correct format.
There is an auto-suggest on the Organisation field to select an existing organisation. If no matching organisation is found, you simply type the name of the organisation and it will be created when you add the user.
